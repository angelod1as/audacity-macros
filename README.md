# Audacity Macros

These are the three main macros I use in order to edit my podcasts on Audacity.

Feel free to fork, edit, whatever.

The main file is `Duplicate for Backup` that duplicates the main audio track to apply non-destructive editing. Then, it calls the `Podcast` macro.

The `Podcast Multi` is an attempt to make multi track editing easier.
